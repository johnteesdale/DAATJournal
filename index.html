        <p>The first kinetic typography example i choose is bit of dialogue from the movie Seven. In the scene the antagonist, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey, is talking to the protagonist, Detective Mills played by Brad Pitt. The scene the deranged killer John Doe is trying to convince Detective Mills that he was killing the bad people and that they all deserved to die. John Doe’s line are represented by a font that is not completely there to represent his crazy nature. Additionally the font has an “off” feeling about it which mimics the acting of the character. Furthermore in screenshot shown the creator of the video choose to underline the repeated dialogue rather than repeat it. This is a great idea because it really stress what the character, John Doe, is saying.</p>

        <p>The second example of kinetic typography is a stand up bit by comedian John Mulaney. In the scene John Mulaney talks about how easy it must have been to get away with crime back in the day. I like use of type to create movement and the type feels as if it is acting out the scene that John Mulaney is describing. The screenshot show a shot when John first starts talking about the 1930 and the creator uses a old feeling font to make the view feel more like they are in the 1930s.</p>
